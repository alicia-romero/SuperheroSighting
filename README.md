# SuperheroSighting

This Superhero Sightings Spring Boot Web App is built with Spring MVC.
As a full-stack app, it stores date in a MySQL database, which I attached.
When using this database first you have to run the creation script,
and change password to your own password.
Also it has a fronted, which the user can interact with.

How it works?
You can open the app in the browser, read the existing superhero sightings,
and add new location, superheroes and sightings.
